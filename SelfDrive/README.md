This Repository contains code for how to make a behaviour-cloning inspired AI that can follow a track.

### Instructions:
Install the Blynk app on your phone and create a new project. Make sure to copy the project's authenication string into your version of the code. Within the Blynk app, setup the v4 pin to be a slider between the values -1 and 1. This will be your steering control. Next setup a toggle switch to v2. This will be your autonomous vs remote control switch. You will also have to configure the motor controller function for your own robot's motor controller. This will take some experimentation. Lastly, most webcams will support the low resolution used in the code, but this is not a garuntee. You may need to also need to setup the opencv resolution according to your webcam. For this project I used the logitech c720 webcam.

(More advanced version with memory coming soon)
